					<div>
						<h5>PRODUCT INTEGRATION TESTING (V3DSTS)</h5>

						<span>This new testing facility, called &ldquo;Production
							Integration Testing&rdquo;, also referred to as the
							&ldquo;V3DSTS&rdquo;, is a remote web-based testing environment that
							provides the equivalent of all components of the 3-D Secure
							infrastructure. The V3DSTS provides Members (and Member processors),
							merchants (and merchant aggregators), and vendors with a 3-D
							Secure environment for production readiness testing of ACS and
							MPI component implementations. All Visa regions have mandated
							that new 3-D Secure implementations successfully complete V3DSTS
							testing prior to entering production.</span>

					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>CHANGES TO TERMS OF SERVICE</h5>
						<span> The terms of service be changed at any time. Visa
							will provide all Members, merchants and vendors who have enrolled
							in Production Integration Testing with reasonable notice of all
							changes and will in good faith review comments received regarding
							the proposed changes. Visa reserves the right to make changes to
							Production Integration Testing that are effective immediately, if
							extreme circumstances, as determined by Visa, require such
							change(s) to be made. </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>CHANGES TO TEST SCRIPTS</h5>
						<span> The test scripts used in conjunction with Production
							Integration Testing will evolve over time. Visa reserves the
							right to add, delete or modify the test scripts at any time. Visa
							also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to require 3-D
							Secure implementations to re-test via the V3DSTS and successfully
							complete one or more test cases. Component implementations that
							have previously undergone Production Integration Testing may be
							requested by Visa to successfully complete testing any such new
							test cases in the V3DSTS environment. </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>DATA RETENTION</h5>
						<span> The V3DSTS will retain all test data for a period of 7
							days upon the time it is executed. It is recommended that testers
							export all the test data prior to the the end of this retention
							period. Visa reserves the right to change the data retention
							period at its sole discretion. </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>TECHNICAL SUPPORT</h5>
						<span> Information specific to Product Integration Testing,
							including the V3DSTS test case descriptions, may be found on the
							Product Integration Testing Web site. </span>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>V3DSTS Web site: https://dropit.3dsecure.net/V3DSTS</div>
					<div>
						<h6>Technical support is provided ONLY for connectivity
							problems with the V3DSTS.</h6>
						<span> There will be no support provided for execution of
							test cases and validation of testing results, nor is there
							support for clarification on testing requirements. The V3DSTS is
							designed to be a self-service facility for testers. Parties
							experiencing problems in establishing connectivity with the
							Production Integration Testing facility should e-mail the V3DSTS
							describing the nature of the problem encountered. Connectivity
							technical support</SPAN> <SPAN style='font-weight: normal'>will
							be available 24X5, Sundays through Thursdays, Eastern Standard
							Time, beginning 12:00 a.m. Sundays and concluding at midnight on
							Thursdays. </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h6>Testers who abuse the technical support system for
							purposes other than actual connectivity problems may be subject
							to removal from the V3DSTS facility and subsequently denied future
							access to the V3DSTS facility.</h6>
						<span> V3DSTS e-mail:austinpitsupport@visa.com </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>HOURS OF OPERATION:</h5>
						<span> The automated Production Integration Testing
							facility is scheduled to be available for ACS and MPI component
							implementation testing on a 24X7 basis, 365 days a year except
							for scheduled and emergency maintenance. </span>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5>TESTING APPROACH</h5>
						<span> The Production Integration Testing (V3DSTS) environment
							utilizes a pre-defined,published set of test cases representing
							numerous transaction processing scenarios essential to the
							quality operation of the 3-D Secure service. </span>
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>These test cases are designed to ensure that new
						component implementations utilize proper message formats,
						correctly populate data and accurately process the 3-D Secure
						transaction test messages.</div>
					<br>
					<div>In addition, some of the other design features of the
						V3DSTS are:</div>
					<div>
						<span style="font-family: Symbol">&middot;<SPAN
							style='font: 7.0pt"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</SPAN></span>Support for
						Version 1.0.2 of the 3-D Secure protocol as well as backward
						compatibility with Version 1.0.1. Earlier versions are not
						supported
					</div>
					<br>
					<div>
						<span style="font-family: Symbol">&middot;<SPAN
							style='font: 7.0pt"Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</SPAN></span>Access, by the
						Visa regional offices, to the results of V3DSTS testing conducted by
						user testing entities within each of their regions
