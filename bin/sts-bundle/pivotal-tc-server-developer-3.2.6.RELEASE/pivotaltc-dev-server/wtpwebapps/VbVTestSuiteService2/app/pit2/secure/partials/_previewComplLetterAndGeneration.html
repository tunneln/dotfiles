					<p>Visa performs limited testing to ascertain a Product’s
						compliance with any required specifications. Visa’s limited
						testing program is not designed to establish the functionality of
						your compliant Product in all potential conditions in which it may
						be used. This letter of compliance does not in any circumstances
						include or imply any guarantees, assurances or warranties that the
						Product will operate in all possible settings or in connection
						with any other compliant product.</p>
					<p>This compliance notice applies only to products that are
						identical to the Product submitted for compliance testing. A
						product should not be considered to be in compliance, nor promoted
						as compliant, if any aspect of the product is different from that
						which was submitted for compliance testing, even if the product
						conforms to the basic Product description contained in this
						letter.</p>
					<p>All products submitted for compliance testing are required
						to be submitted pursuant to Visa’s 3-D Secure Compliance Testing
						Policies and Procedures. The compliance letter is subject in all
						respects to the terms and conditions of the policies and
						procedures document.</p>
					<p>Even though this Product was submitted for compliance
						testing, as described in this letter, the manufacturer of each
						product shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable
						specifications and for all liabilities resulting from the use or
						distribution of the product.</p>
					<p>You may communicate to Visa customer banks, financial
						institutions, merchants and service providers that the Product has
						received a letter of compliance, provided, however, that all
						written communications referring to Visa’s letter of compliance
						shall contain the following legend:</p>

					<p>All products submitted for testing are required to be

						subject in all respects to the terms and conditions of the
						“Agreement.”</p>
					<p>This letter of compliance does not supersede additional
						regional program requirements and/or testing requirements as may
						be imposed by national testing bodies, financial institutions,
						network services providers, or other customers. Manufacturer is
						encouraged to ensure that testing requirements from all relevant
						parties have been met and approvals granted prior to sale or
						installation of the product.</p>
					<p>Visa's letter of compliance is granted solely in connection

						Only those 3-D Secure product manufacturers receiving a Visa
						letter of compliance for a product may claim that they have the
						letter of compliance.</p>
					<p>Visa compliance may be revoked at any time. Because this
						compliance may be revoked at any time, no third party should rely
						on this letter at any time without first confirming the continued
						effectiveness of the compliant product with Visa’s Authentication
						Services. Unless revoked earlier, Visa’s acknowledgement of the
						compliance of the Product shall remain in effect until 02/18/2018.
						Visa reserves the right to modify the terms or duration of this
						compliance at its sole discretion.</p>
